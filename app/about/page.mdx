# Hey there!

I’m Michael Webber—a technology enthusiast, recreational runner, and community media professional.

## Professional Background
For over two decades, I have served as the **Executive Director for a non-profit community media center** in Massachusetts. My work focuses on the intersection of public, educational, and government (PEG) access television. I specialize in live streaming architecture and video production workflow design.

## Academic & Mentorship
Beyond management, I spent nearly twenty years as an **Adjunct Instructor** at a local college. This role allowed me to share my passion for media production with the next generation of creators.

## Community & Personal Projects
Outside of the office, I am deeply involved in **Scouting America**, currently serving as a Committee Chair for a local Scouts BSA Troop.

When I’m not volunteering or on a run, I’m usually tinkering with technology. My current focus is a collaborative project with my son: designing and building an automated, tech-driven outdoor lighting show for the holidays.
