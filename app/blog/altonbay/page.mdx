We are on family vacation this week. Temperatures hit the 40s today, so we skipped the slopes to avoid the "mashed potato" snow and headed to the [Alton Bay Seaplane Base (B18)](https://www.facebook.com/AltonBaySeaplaneBaseandIceRunway). In the winter, this is better known simply as the Ice Runway.

Located on Lake Winnipesaukee, this is the only FAA-approved ice runway in the lower 48 states. It is having a banner year thanks to an early winter and consistent cold. The runway has already surpassed the previous season record of 764 landings.

The wind was light and the skies were clear, making for a very active airfield. We walked onto the ice near a small patch of open water. Even with a childhood spent ice fishing, standing on a frozen lake gives you pause. I was waiting for a thermal "safety crack" to startle the family. Some call them ice quakes. They are normal, but the sound can be unnerving if you are not expecting it. We did not hear any during this visit.

The airfield (aka THE BAY) is a shared space. A community of ice fishing huts sits right alongside the active runway. Trucks use "roadways" on the ice to access the airfield or their bobhouses.

The coordination is impressive. Since there is no control tower, NHDOT personnel in bright orange vests stand on the ice to manage the logistics. They direct traffic along the taxiway and coordinate the constant flow of take-offs and landings. Pilots use a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF) to broadcast their intentions, but in heavy traffic, the ground crew is essential for keeping the ice orderly.

Standing at the perimeter highlights the technical complexities of the operation, from monitoring ice thickness—the runway requires 12 inches of solid ice—to the logistics of maintaining a smooth surface. It is rare to be able to walk to the edge of an active airfield and see aviation this close.

You can see the action from our February 2026 visit in the video below:
