# Moving my Musings to Obsidian

After years on WordPress, I'm transitioning my digital journal to a more local, file-based system. 

### Why the Change?
* **Ownership:** My notes stay in my vault.
* **Speed:** Next.js and Docker on my Contabo VPS are lightning fast.
* **Focus:** Writing in Obsidian allows for deep thinking without the clutter of a CMS dashboard.

### Technology & Learning
This blog isn't just a place for updates; it's a project in itself. Learning to containerize this with Docker has been a great Sunday exercise.
